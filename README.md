# Data Visualization of Global Terror Attacks

## Project Overview

Data tells a story, and with the right tools, we can uncover the narratives hidden within. This project focuses on exploring global terror attacks through data visualization. Additionally, a 'shiny' app was created to allow users to interactively explore features of the data around the world.

## Technologies Used

- **R**
- **Shiny**
- **Data Visualization**

## My Contributions

- Conducting thorough data analysis using R.
- Creating insightful visualizations that make data speak.
- Developing a 'shiny' app for interactive data exploration.

## Report and Script

### R Project File

The project file for RStudio contains the script with all data processing and visualization code.

### Data Visualization Report

A comprehensive report detailing the findings and visualizations.

## Data Files

### Global Terrorism Database

The Global Terrorism Database is a large dataset. You can download the dataset from Kaggle using the following link:

- [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd)

### Population Data (from World Bank)

The population data from the World Bank was utilized to compare the number of terror attacks with the population of each country, allowing for a fair ratio analysis and deeper insights.

    cd Data-Visualisation-Project
    ```

2. **Open the R Project File**:
    - Open `Assessment 2 - Data Visualisation.Rproj` in RStudio.

3. **Install Required Packages**:
    - Ensure you have the necessary packages installed by running:
    ```R
    install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "readr"))
    ```

4. **Run the Shiny App**:
    - Open `Assessment2.R` in RStudio and click on "Run App" to start the Shiny application.

5. **View the Data Visualization Report**:
    - Open `Assessment_2_Data_VisualisationReport.pdf` to read the comprehensive report on the data analysis and visualizations.
